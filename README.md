# Exploratory Data Analysis

The MNIST data set is very good dataset because it doesn't have missing values and it's a balanced data set. Every picture in the dataset is represente by a 28x28 matrix, where every element of the matrix represents a pixel that varies from 0 to 255. At the end, every picture is represented by 784 (28 * 28) columns, so, every pixel is a feature.
